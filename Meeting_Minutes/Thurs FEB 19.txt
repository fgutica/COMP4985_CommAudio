1. High level list of functions we will need for both client and server
2. Pseudocode for the states in the state diagram
3. UI understanding the use of SIGNALS and SLOTS in QT to 
   communicate between other threads with the main trhead
4. The TCP control line is done for the server side. For next week, whoever wants to take up the
   client side of things should do the same thing for the client. Set up the GUI and get the TCP
   control line connecting to the server.

   The main bulk of our design work should be regarding the multicasting, unicasting and peer to peer
   audio streeming functionality. Things like setting up TCP control channels, and getting the GUI working
   are simple, time-consuming things that are good to get out of the way asap so we can have a nice clean
   interface to show Aman at the end and have the bulk of our time working on the communications.
